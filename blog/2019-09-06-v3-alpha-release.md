## Software for the future.

We're finally here! Version 3 of our <a href="/">Structural Analysis and Design API</a> is ready for early adopters and internal use.

Since day one, SkyCiv has been committed to bringing Structural Analysis software to the 21st century. A big part of this is our API. API's allow for far more possibilities beyond traditional software that are restricted to someone manually operating software via a user interface. 

We've seen other industries grow and innovative, with productivity-driven solutions helping them work faster, easier and smarter. It's time for Structural Engineers to join. 


## All our functionality, at your fingertips.

The v3 API opens up almost all of our functionality for your custom needs. This includes:

* Our FEM solver (linear, static, nonlinear, buckling, plates, frequency, response spectrum)
* Steel member design checks (AISC, AISI, AS 4100, CSA S-16, Eurocode 2, British Standards)
* RC Beam and Column design (ACI 318, EN 2, AS 3600, BS 8110, CSA A23)
* Wood member design (NDS, AS 1720)
* Section Builder (custom shapes, geometric properties, section library)
* Reporting - full calculation reporting (for certain design codes), single member reports, analysis reports
* Wind Loading - pull wind speeds, design pressures from an address: ASCE 7-16, AS 1170, EN 1991, NBCC 2015

As a first release this is just a start. We welcome your feedback and function requests to help us build a structural toolbox that serves your needs!
